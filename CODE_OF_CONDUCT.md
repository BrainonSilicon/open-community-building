# Code of Conduct for the Open Research Community Building Team

This Code of Conduct document outlines our expectations for 
participants within the team as well as this online repository (project).
We also provide steps to reporting any concern, uncomfortable situation 
or unacceptable behaviour by other participants. 
We are committed to providing a welcoming, collaborative and inspiring experience 
for all and expect our code of conduct to be honoured.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all members participating in the activities, 
events and processes taking place within the Open Research Community Building Team. 
Specifically, our Code of Conduct applies to any conduct:
- in interactions within the Open Research Community Building Team
- at any team activity, communication or event
- outside the team activity when a team member is representing projects associated with the team
- by members outside the team engaging on the Open Community Building GitHub repository.

## Restorative Practice

We want to establish Code of Conduct that focuses on creating a welcoming and safe environment for
everyone involved -- supporting those who are harmed, not on penalising or excluding individuals.
In the event that a participant does not abide by the Code of Conduct, we will use the 
“restorative practices” approach to handle the situation. Restorative Practices has 
their roots in “restorative justice,” a way of looking at wrongdoing that focuses on 
repairing the harm done to people and the relationships rather than on punishing offenders. 

## Our Commitments

- **Be friendly and patient.**

- **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a project and community that welcomes and supports
  people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to
  members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration
  status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation,
  gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief,
  religion, and mental and physical ability.

- **Be considerate**: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
  will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and
  colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making
  decisions. Remember that we're an open source project. This means that contributors
  might not be communicating in their primary language.

- **Be respectful**: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
  no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some
  frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
  personal attack. It’s important to remember that a project where people feel
  uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

- **Be careful in the words that we choose**: We are
  professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do
  not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary
  behaviour aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to Violent
  threats or language directed against another person, Discriminatory jokes and
  language, Posting sexually explicit or violent material, Posting (or
  threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information
  (“doxing”), Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms,
  Unwelcome sexual attention, Advocating for or encouraging, any of the above
  behaviour, Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to
  stop, then stop.

- **Try to understand why we disagree**: Disagreements, both social and
  technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements
  and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. Diversity
  contributes to the strength of our work, which is composed of people from
  a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on
  issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean
  that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each
  other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and
  learning from mistakes.

### Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a project
for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as
fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a member has made a mistake, we
expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or
offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do
our best to right the wrong.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honour diversity in age,
gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national
origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation,
socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination
based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with
disabilities.

## Restorative Practice Statement and Principles

Restorative practices are based on the belief that human beings are happier, more 
cooperative and productive, and more likely to make positive changes in their behaviour 
when those in positions of authority do things with them, rather than to them or for them. 
The most critical function of restorative practices is restoring and building relationships. 
People in charge must meet with those they have wronged, explore what happened, 
and make necessary amends.

### Restorative Practice Principles

1. focuse on harms rather than rules or persons and the consequent needs of victims, offenders and communities.
2. address obligations of the offender resulting from those harms, as well as the team/community’s obligations to both victims and offenders.
3. use inclusive, collaborative processes.
4. involve all individuals (victims, offenders, parents, students, staff, and faculty) who have a legitimate stake in a given situation.
5. seek to right the wrongs that have been done so that victims feel safe and valued, and offenders feel restored to the team/community

### Restorative Disciplines

1. Acknowledges that relationships are central to the team building
2. Must establish policies and procedures that handle incident reports in a way that strengthens relationships
3. Focuses on harms done rather than rules broken.
4. Gives voice to the person who has been harmed.
5. Engages in collaborative problem solving
6. Empowers change and growth for all involved.
7. Enhances responsibility for actions and attitudes for all involved

The goals of these restorative practices are that Open Research Community Building Team 
would create a safe, friendly and enjoyable space for collaboration and support.
Together we strive to foster an environment where everyone feels valued, respected, and included.

### Reporting Incident

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please report it 
by contacting the Team Lead, Malvika Sharan (email: msharan@turing.ac.uk). Malvika may involve
the Tools, Practices and Systems Programme Director, Kirstie Whitaker when incidents are perceived 
as difficult (not straightforward) except when any potential conflict of interest may arise.

To report an issue involving the team lead, please email directly to the Tools, Practices and Systems 
Programme Director, Kirstie Whitaker (email: kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk). 

In your report please include:

- Your contact information.

- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there
  are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your account of what
  occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly
  available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), please
  include a link.

- Any additional information that may be helpful.

We will respect confidentiality requests all the time for the purpose of protecting individuals who have been harmed.

### Terminology

* Reporter: Person reporting an incident.
* Reportee: Person being reported.

### Report Handling

After receiving a report, the person handling the report (team lead or programme director) 
will review the incident, set a meeting with the reported individual to discuss four restorative questions:
- What happened?
- What were you thinking at the time?
- Who has been affected by what you have done? In what way?
- What do you think you need to do to make things right?

When the incident in question inflicted harm on another person, four additional 
questions will be asked on behalf of the person(s) harmed
- What did you think when you realized what had happened?
- What impact has this incident had on you and others?
- What has been the hardest thing for you?
- What do you think needs to happen to make things right?

The person handling the report may follow up after this discussion with any additional questions to 
help them reach a resolution.

### Resolutions

Here are examples of possible resolutions to a report. 
This list is not comprehensive, and any action necessary to reach a fair resolution will be taken as needed. 
Possible resolutions to an incident include:

- apology to the person harmed or team as a whole
- an action plan for the reportee to improve their awareness and correct future behaviours
- if requested by the person reporting, the reportee will avoid any interaction with the reporter or individual harmed by the incident until communicated by the person handling the report.
- not publishing the content that violated the Code of Conduct, until necessary changes have been made and agreed upon by the person handling the report.
- requiring that the reportee not participate in any synchronous meetings for the time period determined by the person handling the report.
- An imposed suspension, such as asking reportee to “take a week off” from the GitHub repo or team activity).
  
The person handling the report will maintain records of all reports so that they may be reviewed if stronger measures are required when repeated violations occur by the same individual as well as to improve our Code of Conduct for future participation.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the person handling the report will contact the reporter and any other affected parties to explain the proposed resolution. They will ask if this resolution is acceptable and must note feedback for the record. However, they are not required to act on this feedback.
The reportee will be contacted via email informing them of the resolution. A final meeting may be conducted if necessary.

### Conflict of Interest

All reports will be kept confidential with details shared only with people involved in report handling. 
If a person handling the report (team lead or programme director) is linked with the ongoing issue, they will declare their Conflict of Interest and remove themselves from any discussion related to the report handling.
Resolution action may also include identifying appropriate members from within the Open Research Community Building Team if more support for the person handling the report is needed.
