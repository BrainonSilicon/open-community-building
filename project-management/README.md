# Resources for Project Management

Please read the [Ways of Working](./ways-of-working.md) document to understand the structure and organisation of the Open Research Community Building Team, which sets expectations and a tone for the support structure we want to create for all members of our team.

Every team member is expected to participate in the weekly team meetings. 
Our [shared calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=cGtlazVnc2xkcjlwYWRhNjc4MTJyaGtiaW9AZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) will be updated with the times of the meetings, and when meetings are cancelled because they conflict with a relevant event that multiple team members may wish to attend.
Please read the details in [Team Meetings](./team-meetings.md) document.

In the [Resources for Reference](resources-for-reference.md) document, we will collaboratively gather resources from specific projects we work on.
Though this team will primarily focus on open research, community building and topics that are relevant for working in a participatory space, you can share other technical and practical resources that you have found useful in your work.

In the [Asks and Offers](./asks-and-offers.md) document, we will share ideas for exchanging skills.
Under the 'Asks' table, please add what you would like to learn from others and under the 'Offers' table, please list what you would like to teach and share with others.
These 'asks' and 'offers' will also help us find themes for our weekly [team meetings](./team-meetings.md).

Malvika will meet with each community manager individually once per week (if possible) to touch base and keep track of where they are, details for which is provided in the [1:1 meeting folder](./1-1-meetings) directory.
