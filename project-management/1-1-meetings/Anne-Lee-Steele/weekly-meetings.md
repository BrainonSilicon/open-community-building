#### Who did you help this week?
* No help just yet. Setting the foundation for a helpful resource, but just need time to sort through initial interviews and information.
* Sent VK info about CSCCE.
* Sent AR info about the iLab.
--
MS: Thank You Anne for already connecting folks with different projects.

#### Who helped you this week?
* Getting invited to TTW translation systems by BA.
* MS, SG, AR for looking at the netlify issues on TTW.
* Having chats with BA, AD, AR and many more this week that are helping to do think about TTW.
* MK, ABS helping me to plan the fireside
--
- MS: So many exciting connections. Thank you for taking the time to get to know the community. Also, delighted to see you take the lead on the Fireside Chat.

#### What did you achieve?
* System set up + research. Same as last week.
* Will be setting up a folder in 'community building' to hold methodology, while putting TTW-issues with findings and aims directly into the TTW.
* Starting to get up to speed on internal Turing partnerships, and upcoming projects.
--
- MS: I am so impressed by your process documentation skills. We are so delighted that you are taking your community mapping in open and sharing them in TTW.

#### What did you struggle with?
* Struggling to balance speed with efficacy. Keep needing to remind myself that speed isn't the most important, and that I should just focus on people.
--
- MS: We are giving you a lot of information and that is in some ways unavoidable, but there is no expectation that you will know how they fit together immediately. Please take your time to learn about the project, people and ways of working. This is a huge investment that will pay off, and especially through your notes we will gain insights on what opportunities for engagement and support we can create. Please use this time to explore - speed and efficacy is not priorities here - observing and recording is extremely valuable already.

#### What would you like to work on next week?
* More of the same!
--
- MS: THANK YOU! :) Please do take a break from meetings to decompress as needed.

#### Where do you need help?
* Hopefully to review my study findings/info so far at TTW visioning!
--
MS: Booked some coworking sessions. Talk to you soon!

### Project-specific Reflection

* Finished week two! Seems surreal!
* Almost completed outreach for core TTW members.
* Been reflecting a lot on the intersection between art and science, and
* Have been attending a digital arts/culture conference, and X

#### Who did you help this week?

* Ran assistance at TTW talk at AIUK and the fireside chat.

#### Who helped you this week?

- ML has been finding the balance between giving me the reigns, and drip-feeding me info. Much appreciated.
- Many people are warmly welcoming me to TTW. Having lots of scaffolding conversations.
- Conversations from the fireside chat - learned a lot from them.
- Whitaker lab comments on my thread about imposter syndrome were so helpful!

#### What did you achieve?

* Spending lots of time setting up my system, thinking about community research.
* Managed to set up my calendly 'office hours'
* Tuned in/supported a fireside and turing way talk.

#### What did you struggle with?

* I am struggling with keeping my calendar synced between OLS, ISOC, and Turing on all the devices it needs to be on (calendly, ical, outlook)
* I'm not the best at taking notes during interviews/chats. Need to focus on developing better systems!

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I'll be putting some of my *plans* for community research into practice next week.
* Also plan on getting to know TTW github, and having lots of convos with people.

#### Where do you need help?

* Making sure that the materials I'm producing are helpful for people outside of myself.

#### Notes from Malvika:
* Proritise community research: what areas you want to grow, what are my strengths/where are my joys
* Keep in mind people's core time at TTW, and how to reach out + keep accountable
* Keep in mind a quarterly team meeting (core team meeting) into one zoom room. Identify people in core group
* Key q: How do we better engage core members?
* How to identify culture change at the Turing
* Keep track of how people stay engaged with OLS over 4 months
* Note documenting practices in the open, and pathways to work in collaboration - in solidarity - with other projects
* How do we help people to see that working with existing material or code is actually more impactful?
