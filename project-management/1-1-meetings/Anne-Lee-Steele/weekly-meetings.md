## 2022-03-29

#### Who did you help this week?
* No help just yet. Setting the foundation for a helpful resource, but just need time to sort through initial interviews and information.
* Sent VK info about CCSE.
* Sent AR info about the iLab.

#### Who helped you this week?
* Getting invited to TTW translation systems by BA.
* MS, SG, AR for looking at the netlify issues on TTW.
* Having chats with BA, AD, AR and many more this week that are helping to do think about TTW.
* MK helping me to plan the fireside

#### What did you achieve?
* System set up + research. Same as last week.
* Will be setting up a folder in 'community building' to hold methodology, while putting TTW-issues with findings and aims directly into the TTW.
* Starting to get up to speed on internal Turing partnerships, and upcoming projects.

#### What did you struggle with?
* Struggling to balance speed with efficacy. Keep needing to remind myself that speed isn't the most important, and that I should just focus on people.

#### What would you like to work on next week?
* More of the same!

#### Where do you need help?
* Hopefully to review my study findings/info so far at TTW visioning!

### Project-specific Reflection

* Finished week two! Seems surreal!
* Almost completed outreach for core TTW members.
* Been reflecting a lot on the intersection between art and science, and
* Have been attending a digital arts/culture conference, and X

#### Who did you help this week?

* Ran assistance at TTW talk at AIUK and the fireside chat.

#### Who helped you this week?

- ML has been finding the balance between giving me the reigns, and drip-feeding me info. Much appreciated.
- Many people are warmly welcoming me to TTW. Having lots of scaffolding conversations.
- Conversations from the fireside chat - learned a lot from them.
- Whitaker lab comments on my thread about imposter syndrome were so helpful!

#### What did you achieve?

* Spending lots of time setting up my system, thinking about community research.
* Managed to set up my calendly 'office hours'
* Tuned in/supported a fireside and turing way talk.

#### What did you struggle with?

* I am struggling with keeping my calendar synced between OLS, ISOC, and Turing on all the devices it needs to be on (calendly, ical, outlook)
* I'm not the best at taking notes during interviews/chats. Need to focus on developing better systems!

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I'll be putting some of my *plans* for community research into practice next week.
* Also plan on getting to know TTW github, and having lots of convos with people.

#### Where do you need help?

* Making sure that the materials I'm producing are helpful for people outside of myself.

#### Notes from Malvika:
* Proritise community research: what areas you want to grow, what are my strengths/where are my joys
* Keep in mind people's core time at TTW, and how to reach out + keep accountable
* Keep in mind a quarterly team meeting (core team meeting) into one zoom room. Identify people in core group
* Key q: How do we better engage core members?
* How to identify culture change at the Turing
* Keep track of how people stay engaged with OLS over 4 months
* Note documenting practices in the open, and pathways to work in collaboration - in solidarity - with other projects
* How do we help people to see that working with existing material or code is actually more impactful?
