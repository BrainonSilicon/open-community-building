# Eirini and Evelina 1-to-1 meetings

* [TEMPLATE](#TEMPLATE)
* [17 June 2022](#date-17-June-2022)

## Date: 17 Jun 2022

### Check-in ritual
- Sophia has been incredible with the initial onboarding and general support throughout my first days.
- Evelina and Dave have been great for giving more context and information about the RSF.
- Malvika and Emma have been super helpful for getting me to understand the role and ways of working of community managers at the Turing.
- Everyone has just been super welcoming and helpful âœ¨ðŸ¥°

### Project specific Reflection

- I'm starting to understand my role and main tasks a little better.
- There is still a lot I need to learn though!
- There are issues to be solved with advertising and planning (at least) the ECR sessions.
- There are legal considerations blocking/slowing down some work.

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

- I've been spending a lot of time trying to get up to speed with the project and meeting people - is that okay?
- I'm struggling a bit with balancing my urge to meet with the AIM researchers soon and wanting to know more about what they're doing to be able to have more fruitful conversations with them.

#### Who did you help this week?

- Uhm. Attempted to help Evelina with the ECR talk but it was cancelled ðŸ˜…

#### Who helped you this week?

- Literally everyone ðŸ’›
  - Sophia especially with onboarding and all the amazingly detailed documentation
  - Also of course Evelina, Malvika, Dave, and Emma
  - Everyone at TPS and at the office made me feel super welcome (special shout-out to Mahwish and Vicky)

#### What did you achieve?

- Finished HR induction tasks
- Finished IT induction and got set up with various accounts, configurations etc
- Read RSF documentation on GitHub (most of it - haven't gotten to the grant applications etc.)
- Had meetings with many RSF/TPS/Whitaker lab people (Anne, Dave, Hari, Malvika, Emma, Vicky, Zeynep).
- Was able to synthesise some of the knowledge people have been sharing with me.
- Arranged meetings with the remaining Community Managers.

#### What did you struggle with?

- The amount of information/meetings/trying to remember where everything lives.
- A smidge of impostor syndrome?

#### What would you like to work on next week?

- [ ] Work on a plan for next steps for the RSF with Evelina and Sophia.
- [ ] Work on a project proposal for Open Life Science with Sophia.
- [ ] Continue meeting up with relevant people (incl. being introduced to some progamme managers (?) of the consortia)
- [ ] Continue reading RSF documentation (haven't looked at Sharepoint files yet)
- [ ] I haven't received a link to the traning videos from HR - need to follow up with them and watch them.

#### Where do you need help?

- My understanding is that one of my main tasks will be understanding where the consortia are skill-wise and what their training needs are. I will definitely need some help developing a strategy to do that.
- Though I will need help with what I just mentioned and it *is* one of my main responsibilities, I still feel like it'll take a couple of weeks before I'm at a place to actually start doing that. Some help getting a feel of my priorities would be great!

#### Any other topics

- Not really :)
