## Date: 21 June 2022

**Check-in ritual**
- It was lovely to have intro coffees with Vicky, Zeynep, Sarah, and Achintya
- The "Sex, gender, binaries, and categories" talk on Friday was really cool üòª

### Project specific Reflection
- I've made some progress with reading documentation for the AIM RSF.
- I've been working on synthesising the things I've been reading.
- I've scheduled or had meetings with most CMs and I'm trying to meet the most relevant Turing RSF people too.
- Getting better at doing things on GitHub üòä
- Some things need to be changed/redone in terms of organising events.
- I've been feeling a little overwhelmed - I'm making progress with understanding how things work but new things keep popping up!

### Notes to discuss during 1:1
- I haven't been able to get into contributing to the Turing Way yet - it'd be nice to get some tips on getting involved?
- Any tips on managing stress/feelings of being overwhelmed would be very welcome üòä

#### Any other topics
