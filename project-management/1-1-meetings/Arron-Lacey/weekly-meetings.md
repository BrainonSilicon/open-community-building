## Date: 18 January 2022

### Check-in ritual

* Getting back into a rythm now the kids are back in school. 
* KW: And enjoy annual leave! üè°

### Project specific Reflection

* Got an analysis plan sent out to RE and hope he can provide feedback or agree to distribute to wider analytics hub.
  Not heard anything back yet but we are trying to have an internal hub meeting this week.
  * KW: Thank you for talking me through the analysis plan!
* We have two deliverables due by the 7th Feb (one just before the 7th) - the advisory board meeting and EDoN Hub Analysis Plan 2022
  * KW: üôÄ Good to know - I checked with AM and they're on her radar too...

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

#### Who did you help this week?

* I have tried to help the Analytics Hub this week to prepare for our two deliverables.
  Split up tasks for the board meeting and working with DD on bringing it together.
  * KW: So glad you're here! Thank you!

#### Who helped you this week?

* DD has provided a Data Management Plan outline that he has been working on and will be used as materials for the Advisory Board to give feedback on.
  * KW: Team work üôå

#### What did you achieve?

* Markdown file detailing Latent Class Mixture Models (LCMM) for trajectory Analysis in R - build off some ideas Richard has previously proposed.
  * KW: Mega helpful ‚úîÔ∏è
* Got ball rolling on Advisory Board meeting and Analystics 2022 plan
  * KW: Great
* Working on a Stocastic Differential Equation (SDE) as an alternative plan - has potential to be more flexible than LCMM
  * KW: Super interesting

#### What did you struggle with?

* Nothing too much this time.
  Next week will need some good collaboration between the Hub so hopefully that goes ok.
  * KW: Yeaaaaaaah - good heads up for me to be focused next week üëÄ

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Write up material for the following two points for AB meeting
  * The expertise/advice the Turing brings to EDoN regarding open research and accessibility
    * KW: This one is kinda interesting - I think Turing Way is important here, but also probably the work on safe and ethical AI (PPP and S&EAI programme)
    * I think NG could almost certainly help here - probably don't need to write anything completely from scratch. 
  * The impact of open/transparent/ethical approaches on the research and deployment phases of EDoN
    * KW: I think there SHOULD be some good stuff in The Turing Way to cite for this.

#### Where do you need help?

* I will ask the Whitaker Lab team for the most important point that comes to mind for them for both of the bullet points above.
  Optional input of course!
  * KW: Super interesting question to brainstorm! 

#### Any other topics

- Working at Tier 3 SRE - maybe it's all covered but a new pair of eyes can help to brainstorm how we do things.
  - KW: Discussed in the meeting - I think we're going to need to keep anonmyisation (Tier 3) and analyses (Tier 2) completely separate, from a process / safety perspective.
- After we have our Hub deliverables completed I will work with Turing REG and DD on getting Tier 2 github and wiki set up.
  - KW: This looks great ‚úîÔ∏è
