- Not this week


## Date: 25 January 2022

### Check-in ritual

* Back from annual leave!

### Project specific Reflection

* We now have a draft 2022 plan for the hub. Need to review and add actions.
  * KW: I'm hopeful the co-working session tomorrow can get us to the end of this doc ü§û
* We have the advisory board meeting on the 14th Feb. Lisa needs materials mid-next week.
  * KW: üôÄ

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

#### Who did you help this week?

* NA (annual leave)

#### Who helped you this week?

* KW has kept me in the loop!

#### What did you achieve?

* NA (annual leave)

#### What did you struggle with?

* Lifting heavy furniture!
  * KW: üòÖ üí™

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Need to get AB meeting materials circulated to Analytics Hub by end of this week.
  Can draw attention to this at Hub meeting on Friday
* Find out how we can help the PPIE group.
  * KW: One angle is the ethics application
    * Stakeholder mapping, and stakeholder engagement - who are they planning to engage with? Whose voices will be represented?
    * Looking forwards: how do "we" (Analytics Hub) stay in touch with the patience & members of the public?
      * How often connect? In what form?
    * On the current ethics form we ask about the "societal benefits and harms" and it would be great if they were patient led rather than analyst / clinican defined.
  * KW: Another angle is openness and reproducibility - we're going to need to communicate why we're using lots of data from lots of sources.
    * Would be really helpful if members of the public cared about generalisability - having data from various backgrounds.
    * Might need to set up explainers for open research components (open source, metadata vs managed access to data etc)
  * KW: I'd also be really keen for you to take forward the 2x2 risk matrix with members of the public!!!
    * What happens if the ML doesn't add anything? How weak a signal is too weak to continue?!

#### Where do you need help?

* If I get initial draft of AB docs by Thursday if KW could have a quick glance before
  going to Analytics Hub.

#### Any other topics

- Not this week - focussed üéß


## Date: 18 January 2022

### Check-in ritual

* Getting back into a rythm now the kids are back in school. 
* KW: And enjoy annual leave! üè°

### Project specific Reflection

* Got an analysis plan sent out to RE and hope he can provide feedback or agree to distribute to wider analytics hub.
  Not heard anything back yet but we are trying to have an internal hub meeting this week.
  * KW: Thank you for talking me through the analysis plan!
* We have two deliverables due by the 7th Feb (one just before the 7th) - the advisory board meeting and EDoN Hub Analysis Plan 2022
  * KW: üôÄ Good to know - I checked with AM and they're on her radar too...

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

#### Who did you help this week?

* I have tried to help the Analytics Hub this week to prepare for our two deliverables.
  Split up tasks for the board meeting and working with DD on bringing it together.
  * KW: So glad you're here! Thank you!

#### Who helped you this week?

* DD has provided a Data Management Plan outline that he has been working on and will be used as materials for the Advisory Board to give feedback on.
  * KW: Team work üôå

#### What did you achieve?

* Markdown file detailing Latent Class Mixture Models (LCMM) for trajectory Analysis in R - build off some ideas Richard has previously proposed.
  * KW: Mega helpful ‚úîÔ∏è
* Got ball rolling on Advisory Board meeting and Analystics 2022 plan
  * KW: Great
* Working on a Stocastic Differential Equation (SDE) as an alternative plan - has potential to be more flexible than LCMM
  * KW: Super interesting

#### What did you struggle with?

* Nothing too much this time.
  Next week will need some good collaboration between the Hub so hopefully that goes ok.
  * KW: Yeaaaaaaah - good heads up for me to be focused next week üëÄ

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Write up material for the following two points for AB meeting
  * The expertise/advice the Turing brings to EDoN regarding open research and accessibility
    * KW: This one is kinda interesting - I think Turing Way is important here, but also probably the work on safe and ethical AI (PPP and S&EAI programme)
    * I think NG could almost certainly help here - probably don't need to write anything completely from scratch. 
  * The impact of open/transparent/ethical approaches on the research and deployment phases of EDoN
    * KW: I think there SHOULD be some good stuff in The Turing Way to cite for this.

#### Where do you need help?

* I will ask the Whitaker Lab team for the most important point that comes to mind for them for both of the bullet points above.
  Optional input of course!
  * KW: Super interesting question to brainstorm! 

#### Any other topics

- Working at Tier 3 SRE - maybe it's all covered but a new pair of eyes can help to brainstorm how we do things.
  - KW: Discussed in the meeting - I think we're going to need to keep anonmyisation (Tier 3) and analyses (Tier 2) completely separate, from a process / safety perspective.
- After we have our Hub deliverables completed I will work with Turing REG and DD on getting Tier 2 github and wiki set up.
  - KW: This looks great ‚úîÔ∏è
