# 1:1 Arron and Kirstie catch up and notes

* [18 January 2022](#date-18-january-2022)

## Date: 2022-01-18

Check-in ritual
Getting back into a rythm now the kids are back in school. 

### Project specific Reflection

*Review your current projects, relation and skill-building that you are working on.*

Got an analysis plan sent out to Richard Everson and hope he can provide feedback or agree to distribute to wider analytics hub. Not heard anything back yet but we are trying to have an internal hub meeting this week.
We have two deliverables due by the 7th Feb (one just before the 7th) - the advisory board meeting and EDoN Hub Analysis Plan 2022

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

*You can move points from your reflections to the following sections as needed.*

#### Who did you help this week?

I have tried to help the Analytics Hub this week to prepare for our two deliverables. Split up tasks for the board meeting and working with Dan on bringing it together.

#### Who helped you this week?

Dan has provided a Data Management Plan outline that he has been working on and will be used as materials for the Advisory Board to give feedback on.

#### What did you achieve?

* Markdown file detailing Latent Class Mixture Models (LCMM) for trajectory Analysis in R - build off some ideas Richard has previously proposed.
* Got ball rolling on Advisory Board metting and Analystics 2022 plan
* Working on a Stocastic Differential Equation (SDE) as an alternative plan - has potential to be more flexible than LCMM

#### What did you struggle with?

* Nothing too much this time. Next week will need some good collaboration between the Hub so hopefully that goes ok.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Write up material for the follwing two points for AB meeting
    * The expertise/advice the Turing brings to EDoN regarding open research and accessibility
    * The impact of open/transparent/ethical approaches on the research and deployment phases of EDoN

#### Where do you need help?

* I will ask the Whitaker Lab team for the most important point that comes to mind for them for both of the bullet points above. Optional input of course!

#### Any other topics

- Working at Tier 3 SRE - maybe it's all covered but a new pair of eyes can help to brainstorm how we do things.
- After we have our Hub deliverables completed I will work with Turing REG and Dan on getting Tier 2 github and wiki set up.
