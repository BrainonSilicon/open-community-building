# Scoping for the ASG project, repo, community

- Achintya and Malvika
- Date: 2022-02-04

## Repositories

- Community:
    - All about the projects including 'white paper process**
- White Paper Template: 
    - All framework and recommendations that we wish to integrate
    - Developed in parallel with the first paper
- Clones of white paper templates for different projects

### ASG Community

- White papers and community building are interlinked

### White Paper Template 
- Can be used by those outside Turing, gathers evidence for its efficacy
    - Something I’m showcasing more openly, talking about it all the time, hope that the project members adopt it
    - A generic tool for anyone to build a comms package

## The ASG community

### Community Aspects

- Conversation
- Data/tools/methods exchange
- Connecting on common challenges
- Social solutions
- Skill exchange
- Embedding best practices

### Opportunities

- Gems
- Stories
- Examples
- Sharing success, challenges
- Identifying common themes
- Broader communication package
    - We have comms team writing press releases
    - Grant reports
- Greater than the sum of its part

### Values exchange

**What others gain from this project**

- **Accessibility**: There are resources that are not accessible for people who can benefit from them
- **Cross-exchange**: of skills, case studies, lived experience, show case (CM work)
- **Generalisability**: of resources we develop and use
  - ![](https://i.imgur.com/p0H4uFQ.jpg)
- **Recognition**: of their work and themselves in the community 
- **Testing, Evidencing and impact**: (ref for framing in the context of research impact: https://blog.growkudos.com/research-mobilization/research-impact-what-why-how)
- **Co-creation** of institute wide papers
- **Transparency** of decision making

### Issues to address

- Common themes
- Data security, sovereignty
- Tools sharing
- Tools are disconnected from the process

### Why won’t someone engage in this community?

- Time constraints
- Incentives
    - Run it as its own “campaign” to learn what motivates researchers to engage with Achintya’s work
- Not exciting
    - Excited about their work being showcased

## ASG white papers

### Risks for White Papers

- **Time running out**
- People not engaging because of a lack of time (deadlines in other work)
    - Do we know what other deadlines will impact?
    - External events, funding phase
- Quality control
- Co-creation 
    - Skipping community engagement if no time or due to other factors
- Accountability for community members
- Missing out on stakeholders
- Missing content

### Events for Community Assessment and Engagement

- 1:1 with team leads, leadership
- Surveys (evidence, feedback??)
- Kick off: purpose 
    - Understanding interests
    - Messaging
    - Challenges 
    - Successful examples
    - Conversation
    - Stakeholder identification (impact)
- Events to engage with external stakeholders
    - RAM’s involvement in engaging with stakeholder
- Workshops
- Showcase
- Collaborative spaces
    - Writing sprints
    - Illustration sprints
    - Networking
- ?
