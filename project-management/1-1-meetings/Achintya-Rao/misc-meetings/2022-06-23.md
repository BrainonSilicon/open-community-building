## 2022-01-11

- Need to meet individual members of ASG to understand the community
    - Who among the core stakeholders you have not yet managed to meet? 
- Can identify connections once I speak to individual members
- “Nobody knows how this community-building looks like.” What are the needs? What are the connections that exist between teams?
  - I think many of us have the vision for ASG community and overview of how building them would look like. I hope discussion earlier in the week was useful, howeever, we should block a day to work on sketching out some concrete strategy and timeline to share them with others. This will help in communicating what we want to achieve and where we might be misaligned - which would be a place to further feedback and iteration, and especially for engagement.
- Documenting queries, create pathways
    - How can we work towards making them visible? 
- “Have I let the ASG PDRAs know what my agenda is beyond the white papers?”
- HM and KW with planning of ASG workshop agenda

- Thanks in particular to HM for help with the ASG event, to DC for an insightful discussion on measuring the health of communities and to KW for advice on how to conduct lightning talks.

- Special thanks to HM and AY for all their behind-the-scenes help with organising the event
- MS and KW gave me lots of advice on how to run the various sessions
- Met JS and BC at 1:1 networking and discussed collaborating with them
- Social lunch was _really good_ with so many sharing their hobbies and interests
- Took some time to understand how much I had to be involved in shaping of the event. Lots of connections and learning experiences. HM was great support. AY helped so much behind the scene.
- Need to schedule a debrief meeting. AY has also shared a document to add details. 
- ASG community building got a boost from last week’s event
  - Planning with HS on organising regular “meet-up” sessions for ASG PDRAs
  - HS was told by some PDRAs that they felt isolated with their projects from the rest of ASG, and we want to address that
  - Will investigate whether we can get budgets for reimbursed meals for monthly/quarterly social lunches
- JL is unavailable to help with SPARRA glossy so HS asked if I could help: realised that we can recycle lightning talk that other JLy gave at ASG event

- Had meeting with MC about impact measurement, spoke with JS and HR about their projects
- Quite a bit that I’m pleased with
  - The ASG event itself went well from a logistics PoV (with one tiny hiccup)
  - I got feedback from a couple of the speakers that they enjoyed the panels they were on
  - The lightning talks went smooooothly and speakers got to discuss their work in longer breakout sessions
- Following the event, I’ve had some discussions with people I met for the first time (including one longer conversation that will hopefully feed into the E&S white paper that came entirely from the 1:1 networking)
- Staying on top of the E&S white paper itself
- Follow up with speakers who have not replied to ask about putting their talks on Zenodo
- Discuss Poscast idea with BC, sometime next week, if BC is available
- Will be attending the DT:UA meeting at the office on Tuesday

- Been making notes in a notebook to gather various snippets into one place before putting it online into the `asg-community` repo
- Wrote down vision for project as part of OLS-5 mentorship
- Started working on Open Canvas (almost done) and using input from Roadmaps exercise to update schedule for white papers
- Got good feedback on the use of GitHub issues at ASG Management Board, but was told I could provide more clarity: need to make proper labels
- Cleared some (not a lot) of my e-mail backlog, which feels like a bigger achievement than it is
- Started consolidating notes for the white papers from various sources

## 2022-04-11

- Finally launched the E&S white paper.
Felt like a weight off my shoulder, as I hadn’t managed to move forward with it for some time. Launched the drafting phase for the first ASG white paper, which felt a bit overwhelming to get out of the docks. 
- Had a good chat with BC about the potential for ASG podcast episodes/mini-series; see <https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/asg-community/issues/53>.
- Haven’t really had any proper _community_ time lately, but that should change in May once we move to the July hybrid event.

## 2022-05-03

- Unfortunately, there were no edits to the document while I was away.
Going to start engaging the post-docs directly now as we might not get much _direct_ engagement from the senior researchers.
- Contacting post-docs and others recommended by core team to contribute to the E&S white paper; setting up co-working slots for this week and beyond and inviting them to it
- Meeting with ASG central about July event (Thursday); includes debrief from March event
- Have to upload ASG March event talks (been low priority, but now has been two months since the event)
- Start working on SPARRA glossy

Will be doing their on-boarding over Slack and Zoom.
- JD has been curating resources and ideas for the EDT white paper.

- Have _not_ managed to set up co-working slots but will have to do so for after the Book Dash.
- Some point to consider:
  - involve ZI in putting together a time line combined with outputs and stakeholders.
  - Where can the leadership provide steer and support in your work?
  -  Where can you protect your time for white papers?

- Preparing communications to send out to ASG for the July event (priority)
- Responding to some e-mails that have been ignored for too long

## 2022-05-31

### Project-specific reflection

- Have had some very productive meetings with ZI about the ASG event, and the plans are moving forward quite well (more below).
- New contributors to the white papers have been making edits to the document and I’ve also had a co-working session with some (more below as well).

##### ASG July event

- Have had some agenda-planning meetings with ASG central team, HS, ZI, MC and AY.
- I have run the tentative agenda past several PDRAs to get their input on the sessions we have planned.
- Worked with ZI to prepare comms (mostly ZI; I only checked) for the event.
- Went to Birmingham with ZI yesterday to scope out the venue and speak with the venue representative about potential sessions.
- Have worked with JD, DC and AS on the mapathon session at the social event.

##### White papers

- Thoroughly helpful conversations with ZI and ZE have given me renewed energy for the white papers; ZI has prepared a project tracking document and ZI is keen to be involved in the weekly meetings.
- New contributors have been onboarded and have made their first contributions.
- Had a co-working slot all Friday afternoon and co-worked with two PDRAs during that time.
- AC has offered to also help with the overall messaging of the document as they have experience working on such documents.
- Attended (remotely) the meeting to plan the Nature-Turing workshops in September/October, and provided my input for how to proceed; there will be some community-organising work there, but I will need help as it will overlap quite a bit with my white-papers schedules and I won’t be able to devote full attention to it.
- Beginning editing the ASG white paper now that most have fed into the document.
- Contact potential speakers/presenters for ASG event and finalise the panels.
