# Sophia and Bastian Weekly Meeting Notes 

* [6 December 2022](#date-6-December-2022)


## Date: 6 December 2022

### üìç Check-in 
It's a high meeting week at the moment as folks are pushing to get work completed before the holidays. 

#### Project specific Reflection

* NIHR Report 
  * it's reporting season and DC is doing a mountain of work pulling together everything that we've been up to. I've been helping to fill in the sections on PPIE. The aim is to have a full draft by the end of this week that can then be iterated on throughout next week. 
* Theory of Change 
  * MF + CCM need input into PPIE reporting frameworks for the Theory of Change. It's a huge chunk of work that will determine how we're measured for the next 2 years. 
* PPIE Plans
  * We have one last PPIE meeting for the year, and then we need to make plans for what happens in Q1 and finalise details on what groups can co-host and when.  
* RSF GitHub Pages 
  * I've been needing to do a lot more reading than anticipated to plan out and match the hugo templates to the site that the RSF have planned.
