### Check-in ritual
(Examples: recognitions (recognize colleagues), sparkling moments (recognize community members), shout-outs)
Been a busy week, but I'm super ✨ about the work that's got done and the direction things are heading. DC is an absolute rockstar and I'm really excited to meet our new team members!

### Project specific Reflection

Feeling a bit stuck in places due to not having a clear picture of what’s going on inside the consortia. 
We need to get an information processing piece in place, and after that’s confirmed then I might be able to start reaching out to folk and having coffee chats to get an idea of what’s going on. 
So I’m feeling a bit stuck unable to identify the known unknowns, and daunted but unknown unknowns.
* EK - get yourself invited to project meetings so that you can be that lurker - listen for people of interest and also tasks you can intervene. 

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

* Approaching AutSPACEs workblocks
	* EK - planning of what task need doing, time they will take and deadlines for doing each - work out with GA. Also think about blocking some time to do this work.

## Date: 24 May 2022

### Check-in ritual
Have been feeling very appreciated by the team lately. Good vibes all around.
* EK - I am getting great feedback on how you are doing so a big well done!

### Project specific Reflection

Got a lot of clarity around work remit, project scope, and work tasks in the past week which is great! The citizen science platform is a big part of work that is a priority for the project. It will require focus groups first and appropriate scoping, but it is a big piece that we’re moving forward with. There’s a lot of work coming down the pipeline now and I have a better understanding of how to prioritise tasks aligned with the bigger picture. 
* EK - this is great for getting clarity on tasks.

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

* Run through updates, larger discussion on the ["help" task](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/open-community-building/edit/main/project-management/1-1-meetings/Sophia-Batchelor/weekly-meetings.md#where-do-you-need-help)
	* Am unsure how to balance "I can support or take on a task" with the worry that I'm taking work off people. I feel like I can keep myself busy but also have tasks flagged as key that I don't know how to/if I should take over. 
	* EK - I have met with DC and MS about producing a minimum set of task for you and then some 'what would be nice' add ons. DC should get this to us this week.

* EG with running the ECR session
* DC with some github workflows
* GA & AutSPACEs team with some strategy work

#### Any other topics



## Date: 17 May 2022

### Check-in ritual

DC (and EB with all the set up!!) has been an absolute star. I've been seeing the amount of invisible work that he does and it's brill ⚡

### Project specific Reflection

* Have found (almost) all the docs! It was a massive unblocking to get access to things and read through them to understand the project and how I'm meant to fit in. 
* Am still finding my feet understanding what my role is within the bigger picture - but I know this will become clear with time (and once I've met with LC) 
	* EK - Good progress getting access to all docs. 🌟

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

* EK - keep asking for help where you need it. Wonderful that you have DC and EG for support. 

#### What did you achieve?
> these are easy wins as they're 'learning' and 'get to know folk' focused. 

**Big Win:** 🌟 I made a flyer (that I was quite proud of) and drafted up information about the ECR lunch session to be sent out. 
* EK - the flyer looks fab. 

Community Management:
* ✅ Have got access to the GitHub Repo and Sharepoint and am familair with the contents

PPIE/Focus Groups:
* ✅ Read through the TREx forms and have started scoping what sort of questions the focus groups are needed for.

## Date: 10 May 2022

### Check-in ritual
* AB was a massive help double checking some admin & reimbursement forms I was unsure about AND had a great coffee last week getting me up to speed
* EG was super awesome getting me up to speed with the RSF
* Awesome onboarding session with MS, DC, & EB
* Super grateful for folks from the Public Policy team who took me to lunch on Friday
	* EK - great that you have connected with so many people already. 🌟

### Project specific Reflection

* Current tasks are about getting up to speed with where things are at with the RSF, and what sort of work do I need to muck in on short term. 
  * There seems to be a good opportunity to lead with some Turing Way workflows in how notes and the like are stored & shared. Will need to have a few scoping conversations to figure out what the best way forward will be. 
  	* EK - let's chat about DECOVID repo when you start working no your repository. 	
	* This presents a small challenge as putting a line in the sand and forcing everything into markdown and github may not meet the community where they are and so deep thinking is needed. 
* Worked to integrate reviewer feedback for a conference submission on AutSPACEs with GA. Am exploring/figuring out what the split between AutSPACEs and AIM will be.
	* EK - This is great!  

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

* Feeling like I'm not necessarily doing "tasks" at the moment. Am just unsure of if I should be working harder and mucking in more: and am finding the balance difficult between the phd mindset vs working life mindset where it's okay to not solve all the world's problems in a day. 
	* EK - start a few of the tasks from your list sent last friday such as community mapping and glossary - drawing info together that you have and then asking for input.   

#### Who did you help this week?

* GA with integrating reviewer feedback
* DC & EB with brainstorming some operational steps for AIM that support an open workflow
	* EK - great work! 

#### Who helped you this week?

* Everyone!
	* Onboarding: MS (with the awesome checklist), EK, EB & DC, EG, AB
	* Feeling welcome: everyone as listed above and also JD, AC, VH, + Turing office folk 

#### What did you achieve?

* Connected with RSF collaborators CN and MF via email 
* Set up coffee call with CN (collaborator) (DC suggested we get in touch) 
* Worked on a revision request for a conference workshop for AutSPACEs
* Connected with DC around RSF strategy and working openly
* Finished reading through RSF github repo
* Finished HR onboarding & Cyber Security training
* Started working on reimbursement forms 
* Onboarded into cm-team with MS
* Met with 4 of Turing's leads on the AIM RSF and synthesized an overview of the project & my role
	* ⚠️ would appreciate guidance on where the from the email notes can be stored
* Collated preliminary scope of my responsibilities 

#### What did you struggle with?

* Covid delays have made it difficult to meet with specific PPIE folk
	* EK - Just keep asking when you can connect.  
* General feelings of "should I be doing something more useful with my time" 
	* EK - you have already done so much! Keep going to meetings, listening and meeting more people - this is the unseen work of community managers. 
* Also need to keep an eye on how I'm structuring my days as I'm starting early and finishing late and have been excited and caught up in tasks so haven't taken clever breaks. It was the first week though, so it's a self-check more than anything else. 
	* EK - Something to keep an eye on - you will find a good routine once you are fully settled in. 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

- [ ] Continue reading through the resources shared by Dave and Elizabeth, & what is on the GitHub repo. 
- [ ] Organise a meeting with LC and other PPIE folk to understand the PPIE work that is being done.
- [ ] Attend all AIM RSF meetings and get a deeper understanding of how my work fits in 
- [ ] Bubble away at ethics approval, glossary, community mapping and open workflow. 

#### Where do you need help?

* Brainstorming where to start on 'creating an open workflow that embodies TPS principles into AIM RSF'. Don't need an instant solution, more so an experienced sounding board to help formalize ideas and think up the right questions to ask. 

#### Any other topics

* You've mentioned that you maintain a repo that is mainly used by you (and not collaborators). Can I ask why others don't use it? (I'm trying to scope out how open consortia folks will be to github workflows).
