# Sophia and Emma 1 to 1 weekly meetings

* [10 May 2022](#date-10-May-2022)


## Date: 10 May 2022

### Check-in ritual
* AB was a massive help double checking some admin & reimbursement forms I was unsure about AND had a great coffee last week getting me up to speed
* EG was super awesome getting me up to speed with the RSF
* Awesome onboarding session with MS, DC, & EB
* Super grateful for folks from the Public Policy team who took me to lunch on Friday

* EK - great that you have connected with so many people already. üåü

### Project specific Reflection

* Current tasks are about getting up to speed with where things are at with the RSF, and what sort of work do I need to muck in on short term. 
  * There seems to be a good opportunity to lead with some Turing Way workflows in how notes and the like are stored & shared. Will need to have a few scoping conversations to figure out what the best way forward will be. 
  	* EK - let's chat about DECOVID repo when you start working no your repository. 	
	* This presents a small challenge as putting a line in the sand and forcing everything into markdown and github may not meet the community where they are and so deep thinking is needed. 
* Worked to integrate reviewer feedback for a conference submission on AutSPACEs with GA. Am exploring/figuring out what the split between AutSPACEs and AIM will be.
	* EK - This is great!  

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

* Feeling like I'm not necessarily doing "tasks" at the moment. Am just unsure of if I should be working harder and mucking in more: and am finding the balance difficult between the phd mindset vs working life mindset where it's okay to not solve all the world's problems in a day. 
	* EK - start a few of the tasks from your list sent last friday such as community mapping and glossary - drawing info together that you have and then asking for input.   

#### Who did you help this week?

* GA with integrating reviewer feedback
* DC & EB with brainstorming some operational steps for AIM that support an open workflow
	* EK - great work! 

#### Who helped you this week?

* Everyone!
	* Onboarding: MS (with the awesome checklist), EK, EB & DC, EG, AB
	* Feeling welcome: everyone as listed above and also JD, AC, VH, + Turing office folk 

#### What did you achieve?

* Connected with RSF collaborators CN and MF via email 
* Set up coffee call with CN (collaborator) (DC suggested we get in touch) 
* Worked on a revision request for a conference workshop for AutSPACEs
* Connected with DC around RSF strategy and working openly
* Finished reading through RSF github repo
* Finished HR onboarding & Cyber Security training
* Started working on reimbursement forms 
* Onboarded into cm-team with MS
* Met with 4 of Turing's leads on the AIM RSF and synthesized an overview of the project & my role
	* ‚ö†Ô∏è would appreciate guidance on where the from the email notes can be stored
* Collated preliminary scope of my responsibilities 

#### What did you struggle with?

* Covid delays have made it difficult to meet with specific PPIE folk
	* EK - Just keep asking when you can connect.  
* General feelings of "should I be doing something more useful with my time" 
	* EK - you have already done so much! Keep going to meetings, listening and meeting more people - this is the unseen work of community managers. 
* Also need to keep an eye on how I'm structuring my days as I'm starting early and finishing late and have been excited and caught up in tasks so haven't taken clever breaks. It was the first week though, so it's a self-check more than anything else. 
	* EK - Something to keep an eye on - you will find a good routine once you are fully settled in. 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

- [ ] Continue reading through the resources shared by Dave and Elizabeth, & what is on the GitHub repo. 
- [ ] Organise a meeting with LC and other PPIE folk to understand the PPIE work that is being done.
- [ ] Attend all AIM RSF meetings and get a deeper understanding of how my work fits in 
- [ ] Bubble away at ethics approval, glossary, community mapping and open workflow. 

#### Where do you need help?

* Brainstorming where to start on 'creating an open workflow that embodies TPS principles into AIM RSF'. Don't need an instant solution, more so an experienced sounding board to help formalize ideas and think up the right questions to ask. 

#### Any other topics

* You've mentioned that you maintain a repo that is mainly used by you (and not collaborators). Can I ask why others don't use it? (I'm trying to scope out how open consortia folks will be to github workflows).
