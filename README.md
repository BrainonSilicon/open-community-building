# Open Research Community Building at The Alan Turing Institute

*Establishing cross-community collaborations and promoting open research in data science*

## Background

Community building is a rewarding experience as we get to see our community members grow and move from the position of spectators or users to developers and leaders in the project.
Community managers help others in finding ways to engage with the project, enabling access to the skills and resources they need to participate and taking care of the 'hidden background work' required to make visible works effective.

Among other projects specific and technical tasks, these background works involve collaboration, acknowledgement and celebration for their community members' work.
But, working in community building can be a lonely and overwhelming experience if a similar support system and acknowledgement pathway for the community managers are not available.

The **Open Research Community Building** team provides such a space for connection, support and skill-building for the community managers and members in similar but differently-named roles.

## Open Research Community Building Team

Members of the Open Research Community Building team invest in engaging, training and empowering a diverse group of researchers, research engineers, programme management, and business team members by fostering diverse Communities of Practice through their projects. 

Through the active adoption of open research, reproducibility and collaborative approaches primarily drawn from [*The Turing Way*](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/), they contribute toward building interconnected systems of open source software, datasets, communities and processes.
The overarching mission is to make research and innovation more efficient and effective across the national and international data science ecosystem for commercial and public interest technologies alike.

## Community Managers at Turing

The Turing community managers join the [Tools, Practices and Systems](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems) (TPS) Research Programme's [Open Research Community Building](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems/community-management-and-open-research) project.

They are assigned to specific projects where they collaborate closely with others and identify where they can surface implicit knowledge and make information explicitly available so that everyone who wants to can participate. 
As a team, we ensure that the research that happens at the Institute is created to be maintained, sustained, remixed and reused.

## Guiding Principles

- Maintain respect, empathy and integrity within the team.
- Actively identify opportunities for collaboration and practising open research principles.
- Prioritise diversity, equity and inclusion in all our work.
- Contribute to the ongoing professional development of team members to maximise their contribution to the team's work, their careers, and open research at large.
- Provide access to resources that empower and enable each other to discover, display and directly use their knowledge and skills.
- Create a safe and non-judgemental environment to admit errors and draw learnings from our mistakes.
- Collaborate with individuals and institutions beyond the team that expand and extend our mission for open research and community building.
- Be willing to work through conflicts to resolution.
