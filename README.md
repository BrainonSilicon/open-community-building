# Open Research Community Building at The Alan Turing Institute

*Establishing cross-community collaborations and promoting open research in data science*

Community managers at the Turing invest in engaging, training and empowering a diverse group of researchers, research engineers, programme management, and business team members by fostering diverse Communities of Practice. 
The Turing community managers are assigned to specific projects where they collaborate closely with others and identify where they can surface implicit knowledge and make information explicitly available so that everyone who wants to can participate. 

With other community managers at the institute, they join the [Tools, Practices and Systems Research Programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems)'s [Open Research Community Building](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems/community-management-and-open-research) project.
As a team, we ensure that the research that happens at the Institute is created to be maintained, sustained, remixed and reused.

Through the active adoption of open research, reproducibility and collaborative approaches in data science projects, they contribute toward building interconnected systems of open source software, datasets, communities and processes.
The overarching mission is to make research and innovation more efficient and effective across the national and international data science ecosystem for commercial and public interest technologies alike.
