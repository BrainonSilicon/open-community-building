# Open Research Community Building at The Alan Turing Institute

*Establishing cross-community collaborations and promoting open research in data science*

## Background

Community building is a process of enabling members in our communities to move from the position of spectators or users to developers and leaders in the project.
Community managers and people in similar roles identify and build meaningful pathways for everyone to gain access to the skills and resources they need to participate in the community.
Among other project-specific and technical responsibilities, they take care of background work needed to make tangible and visible work of their communities effective. 
These background works involve approaches for collaboration, maintenance and acknowledgment of community members' work.
As the word 'background' suggests, such work often stay hidden and unsupported, especially if only one person is making them happen.

Working in community spaces can be challenging if we don't have appropriate opportunities to seek support in our work and exchange best practices with other community developers.
The **Open Research Community Building** team at The Alan Turing Institute provides such a space for connection, support and skill-building for the community managers and members working in participatory and community-oriented projects.

## Open Research Community Building Team

Members of the Open Research Community Building team invest in engaging, training and empowering a diverse group of researchers, research engineers, programme management, and business team members by fostering diverse Communities of Practice through their projects. 

Through the active adoption of open research, reproducibility and collaborative approaches primarily drawn from [*The Turing Way*](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/), they contribute toward building interconnected systems of open source software, datasets, communities and processes.
The overarching mission is to make research and innovation more efficient and effective across the national and international data science ecosystem for commercial and public interest technologies alike.

### Community Managers at Turing

The Turing community managers join the [Tools, Practices and Systems](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems) (TPS) Research Programme's [Open Research Community Building](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems/community-management-and-open-research) project.

They are assigned to specific projects where they collaborate closely with others and identify where they can surface implicit knowledge and make information explicitly available so that everyone who wants to can participate. 
As a team, we ensure that the research that happens at the Institute is created to be maintained, sustained, remixed and reused.

![People across different communities act as physical bridges between two separate projects and find solutions that are mutually beneficial. There is no replacement of people in technology.](https://zenodo.org/api/iiif/v2/867e0f11-b7cb-460e-9c3b-487ac75ada36:849be739-8880-41cc-a487-215fb325d91f:people-find-solutions.jpg/full/750,/0/default.jpg)
