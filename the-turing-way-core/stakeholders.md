Collaborating Projects/Organisation
===================================

The Turing Way community receives in-kind contributions from members supported by their employers, projects, or organisations for their participation. Such contributions are applicable when one or multiple members from a project or organisation collaborate to build and maintain resources in The Turing Way. These contributions also include projects that build upon The Turing Way resources or collaborate with The Turing Way team members in various capacities. We acknowledge each of these contributing members individually and list their profiles under “Collaborating organisations and projects”: [](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record.html#collaborating-organisations-and-projects)[https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record.html#collaborating-organisations-and-projects](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record.html#collaborating-organisations-and-projects)
