# Roles of Core Members of The Turing Way

Collaboration among the community managers and researchers across different projects is crucial for the success of the Open Research Community Building team.
Weekly meetings are not sufficient to enable effective collaboration, therefore, *The Turing Way* is an excellent project to bring them together under the same umbrella as core contributors.

*The Turing Way* is a flagship project to ensure that best practices in data science and research are consistently promoted across all projects at the institute.
We want all members to take time to explore, exchange and understand how:
* they can enable reproducibility, open communication and ethical research in their Communities of Practice.
* they can identify people, projects and resources that are crucial for the development, maintenance and sustainability of their projects.
* they can interconnect their work with other projects and communities in the wider landscape of data science and open research.
* they can enable openness, collaboration and transparent reporting, even when not all components from their projects can be made public.
* they can find support for their community work in the team and exchange support others in their work.
* they can enhance their technical understanding required in the project and share them via *The Turing Way* (chapters, tutorials, templates or events).

Please note that *The Turing Way* serves researchers at The Alan Turing Institute as well as more broadly people working in data science at the national and international research communities.
Therefore, we can regularly step back to consider, what practices from our projects are transferable, how they can benefit other researchers and how this can be communicated via *The Turing Way*.
In addition to the open-ended scope of the core team, below some specific pathways to engage with *The Turing Way* community have been listed.

## Chairing Coworking Calls

*The Turing Way* team has been hosting shorter coworking calls each week. These calls are similar to the Collaboration Cafes, but only 1-hour long. Since May 2020, these calls have been taking place multiple days each week at 11:00 GMT/BST. It is not hosted on the days when there is a Collaboration Cafe already scheduled.
Please read about the [Coworking Calls on *The Turing Way*](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coworking.html).

We encourage all community managers to join these co-working calls.
Chair for each week's Coworking Call will be assigned based on who from the core team is available and joining that week.
Please familiarise yourself with the format, resources and what involves in the [participation and chairing of Coworking Calls](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coworking/coworking-weekly.html).

## Chairing Collaboration Cafe

*The Turing Way* Collaboration Cafes (or ‘Cafés’ with an accent) are virtual co-working spaces that are held fortnightly on the first and third Wednesdays of each month for 2 hours. 
Please read about the [Collaborate Cafes on *The Turing Way*](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coworking/coworking-collabcafe.html).

We encourage all community managers to attend Collaboration Cafes regularly.
The chair for each Collaboration Cafe will be assigned based on who from the core team is available and joining that week.

## Participating Book Dash

*The Turing Way* Book Dash events are a less intense version of Book Sprints, where participants collaboratively work on *The Turing Way* book synchronously.
Most of our collaboration in *The Turing Way* happen asynchronously, hence the Book Dash is organised to bring together interested members either in person for 1-2 full days or small sessions each day for a week (2.5 hours long, organised in multiple time zones) when organised online to develop new chapters and review/edit existing ones to make them more accessible, comprehensive and up-to-date. They also contribute to enhancing the project by improving the ways we work in the community and taking the lead on accomplishing different tasks or subprojects.
Please read about the [Book Dash on *The Turing Way*](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash.html).

We encourage all community managers to attend set aside time for one or both Book Dash annually.
This will be an opportunity to document practices from their projects in *The Turing Way* chapters, collaborate with others within and beyond the team on shared interests, become part of the Book Dash planning committee if already participated in a previous Book Dash or take on other community-facing roles (mentor, reviewer, chair, social media manager) for the event.

## Organising Fireside Chat

The Turing Way Fireside chat series feature experts, champions and their projects from across different international communities in reproducibility, open research, ethics, collaboration and everything in between. 
This is an opportunity for catalysing cross-community collaboration and knowledge sharing.
Previous topics include an introduction to *The Turing Way*, shared concerns in cross-community collaboration and translation in data science.
Find details in the [Fireside Chat HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/fireside-chats).

You are invited to design and chair future discussions that can include topics related but not limited to building cross-community collaborations, establishing context-specific support systems and working together towards global sustainability of the open infrastructure.
