# Roles of Core Members of The Turing Way

Collaboration among the community managers and researchers across different projects is crucial for the success of the Open Research Community Building projects. 
_The Turing Way_ is an excellent project to bring all community managers and researchers together under the same umbrella as core members and contributors.

_The Turing Way_ is a flagship project to ensure that best practices in data science and research are consistently promoted across all projects at the institute. 
_The Turing Way_ is used not only by researchers at The Alan Turing Institute but more broadly by people working in data science at the national and international research communities. 
Hence, it is important to consider what practices from our projects are transferable and should be shared in _The Turing Way_ to benefit other researchers.

In addition to the broader scope described in the project (see [Working with *The Turing Way*](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/open-community-building/blob/main/README.md#working-with-the-turing-way)), below you will find some specific pathways for the core team members to engage with _The Turing Way_ community.

## Chairing Coworking Calls

_The Turing Way_ team has been hosting shorter coworking calls each week. 
These calls are similar to the Collaboration Cafes, but only 1-hour long. Since May 2020, these calls have been taking place multiple days each week at 11:00 GMT/BST. 
It is not hosted on the days when there is a Collaboration Cafe already scheduled. Please read about the [Coworking Calls on _The Turing Way_](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coworking.html).

We encourage all community managers to attend these co-working calls. Chair for each week will be assigned based on who from the core team is available and joining that week. 
Please familiarise yourself with the format, resources and what involves in the [participation and chairing of Coworking Calls](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coworking/coworking-weekly.html).

## Chairing Collaboration Cafe

_The Turing Way_ Collaboration Cafes (or ‘Cafés’ with an accent) are virtual co-working spaces that are held fortnightly on the first and third Wednesdays of each month for 2 hours. 
Please read about the [Collaborate Cafes on _The Turing Way_](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coworking/coworking-collabcafe.html).

We encourage all community managers to attend Collaboration Cafes regularly. 
The chair for each Collaboration Cafe will be assigned based on who from the core team is available and joining that week.

## Participating in Book Dash Events

_The Turing Way_ Book Dash events are a less intense version of Book Sprints, where participants collaboratively work on _The Turing Way_ book synchronously. 
Most of our collaboration in _The Turing Way_ happen asynchronously, hence the Book Dash is organised to bring together interested members either in person for 1-2 full days or small sessions each day for a week (2.5 hours long, organised in multiple time zones) when organised online to develop new chapters and review/edit existing ones to make them more accessible, comprehensive and up-to-date. 
They also contribute to enhancing the project by improving the ways we work in the community and taking the lead on accomplishing different tasks or subprojects. 
Please read about the [Book Dash on _The Turing Way_](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash.html).

We encourage all community managers to attend set aside time for one or both Book Dash annually. 
This will be an opportunity to document practices from their projects in _The Turing Way_ chapters, collaborate with others within and beyond the team on shared interests, become part of the Book Dash planning committee if already participated in a previous Book Dash or take on other community-facing roles (mentor, reviewer, chair, social media manager) for the event.

## Organising Fireside Chats

The Turing Way Fireside chat series feature experts, champions and their projects from across different international communities in reproducibility, open research, ethics, collaboration and everything in between. This is an opportunity for catalysing cross-community collaboration and knowledge sharing. 
Previous topics include an introduction to _The Turing Way_, shared concerns in cross-community collaboration and translation in data science. 
Find details in the [Fireside Chat HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/fireside-chats).

You are invited to design and chair future discussions that can include topics related but not limited to building cross-community collaborations, establishing context-specific support systems and working together towards global sustainability of the open infrastructure.
